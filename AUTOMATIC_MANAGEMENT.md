# Automatic Battery Management Strategy

Based on extensive research into battery longevity best practices, this app implements intelligent automatic management to maximize your MacBook's battery lifespan.

## Core Principles

### 1. The 80% Rule
- **Scientific Basis**: Charging to 80% instead of 100% can increase battery lifespan by 4x
- **Implementation**: Default charge limit set to 80% for daily use
- **Override**: Automatically charges to 100% when unplugged usage patterns predict need

### 2. Temperature Management
- **Optimal Range**: 50-95째F (10-35째C)
- **Heat Protection**: Automatically pauses charging above 104째F (40째C)
- **Cool Down**: Enforces 15-minute cooldown periods after temperature events

### 3. Adaptive Charging Modes

#### Workday Mode (60-80% charge)
- For users who keep MacBook plugged in most of the day
- Maintains battery between 60-80% to minimize stress
- Enables "sailing mode" - periodic discharge while plugged in

#### Mobile Mode (80-95% charge)
- For users who frequently work unplugged
- Maintains higher charge for portability
- Balances longevity with practical needs

#### Travel Mode (40-80% charge)
- Maximum battery preservation
- Ideal for extended trips
- Implements strict 40-80% charging cycle

#### Adaptive Mode (ML-based)
- Learns your usage patterns
- Predicts optimal charge levels
- Adjusts based on:
  - Time of day
  - Day of week
  - Historical usage
  - Upcoming calendar events

### 4. Smart Features

#### Sailing Mode
- Discharges battery while plugged in
- Prevents constant 100% charge state
- Activates after 1 hour at >95% charge

#### Calibration Reminders
- Monthly calibration recommended
- Full discharge to 15%, then charge to 100%
- Maintains accurate battery readings

#### Usage Pattern Learning
- Tracks plug/unplug times
- Monitors daily usage percentages
- Identifies peak usage hours
- Predicts future needs

## Automatic Behaviors

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning**: Charges to predicted daily requirement
2. **Work Hours**: Maintains optimal level based on mode
3. **Evening**: Adjusts for overnight charging
4. **Weekend**: Adapts to different usage patterns

### Smart Decisions
- **Before meetings**: Ensures adequate charge
- **During sleep**: Limits to 80% unless morning usage expected
- **Hot days**: Reduces charge limit for temperature protection
- **After updates**: Recalibrates predictions

## User Control

While automatic management handles most scenarios, users can:
- Override for specific events (presentations, travel)
- Set custom charge limits
- Disable automatic features
- View management decisions and reasoning

## Battery Health Monitoring

Tracks and displays:
- Current health percentage
- Cycle count
- Temperature history
- Charging patterns
- Predicted lifespan

## Privacy

All learning and predictions happen locally. No usage data is sent to external servers.
