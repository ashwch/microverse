### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: macOS Security Permissions

**When you first launch Microverse, macOS will block it because it's not from an identified developer.**

To run Microverse:

1. **First attempt**: Double-click Microverse ‚Üí You'll see "Microverse can't be opened"
2. **Open System Settings** ‚Üí Privacy & Security
3. **Scroll down** to see "Microverse was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer"
4. **Click "Open Anyway"** ‚Üí Enter your password if prompted
5. **Click "Open"** in the popup dialog

*This is a one-time process. After allowing it once, Microverse will launch normally.*
