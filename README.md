```bash
git clone git@github.com:ashwch/microverse.git
cd microverse
```

2. Build using Swift Package Manager:
```bash
swift build --product Microverse --configuration release
```

3. The built app will be in `.build/release/Microverse`

### Running the App

1. Copy the built binary to Applications folder
2. Launch Microverse from Applications
3. Look for the battery icon in your menu bar

## Usage

### Menu Bar
- Click the battery icon to open the status popover
- Shows current charge percentage, status, cycles, and health
- Access settings to customize display options

### Settings

## Architecture

Built with:
- **SwiftUI** for modern UI
- **IOKit** for battery information
- **SPM** for dependency management

Key components:
- `BatteryCore`: Core battery monitoring logic
- `MenuBarApp`: Menu bar application management
- `DesktopWidget`: Floating widget implementation
- `CleanMainView`: Main UI popover

## Development

See [Widget Design Specification](docs/WidgetDesignSpec.md) for detailed implementation guidelines.

### Key Implementation Rules
1. Never use ZStack as root container (causes clipping)
2. Always set explicit frame sizes matching window dimensions
3. Apply backgrounds last in view hierarchy
4. Keep padding inside frames
5. Test with edge cases (100% battery, long time strings)
