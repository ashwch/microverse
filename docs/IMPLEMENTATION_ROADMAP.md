# Microverse Expansion - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transform Microverse from a battery monitor into a comprehensive system intelligence hub - your personal developer universe in the menu bar.

## MVP Feature Set

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Create the architectural foundation without breaking existing functionality

#### Tasks:
1. **Create SystemCore Framework**
   ```bash
   Sources/
   ├── SystemCore/
   │   ├── SystemReader.swift      # Unified metrics collection
   │   ├── CPUMonitor.swift       # CPU-specific logic
   │   ├── MemoryMonitor.swift    # Memory-specific logic
   │   ├── ProcessMonitor.swift   # Process enumeration
   │   └── SystemTypes.swift      # Shared data types
   ```

2. **Refactor BatteryViewModel**
   - Extract battery-specific logic to BatteryCore
   - Create SystemViewModel as parent
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Implement Basic CPU Monitoring**
   ```swift
   struct CPUMetrics {
       let usage: Double           // 0-100%
       let coreCount: Int
       let processCount: Int
       let topProcess: ProcessInfo?
   }
   ```

4. **Implement Basic Memory Monitoring**
   ```swift
   struct MemoryMetrics {
       let used: Double           // GB
       let total: Double          // GB
       let pressure: Float        // 0-1
       let topProcess: ProcessInfo?
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: UI Foundation (Week 2)
**Goal**: Implement tab-based navigation with minimal UI

#### Tasks:
1. **Create Tab Navigation**
   - Overview, Battery, CPU, Memory tabs
   - Smooth transitions
   - Keyboard navigation

2. **Design Overview Tab**
   - Simple text-based metrics initially
   - Layout framework for future ring visualization

3. **Create CPU Tab**
   - CPU usage percentage
   - Basic process list (top 5)
   - No fancy visualizations yet

4. **Create Memory Tab**
   - Memory usage display
   - Pressure indicator
   - Basic process list (top 5)

5. **Update Existing Widgets**
   - Add CPU/Memory to minimal widget
   - Keep battery-only option for compatibility

### Phase 3: Process Intelligence (Week 3)
**Goal**: Smart process categorization and tracking

#### Tasks:
1. **Process Categorization**
   ```swift
   enum ProcessCategory {
       case development    // Xcode, VSCode, Terminal
       case browser       // Safari, Chrome, Firefox
       case communication // Slack, Discord, Messages
       case media        // Spotify, Music, QuickTime
       case productivity // Notes, Calendar, Mail
       case system       // Finder, Dock, etc.
       case other
   }
   ```

2. **Developer Tools Detection**
   - Auto-detect common dev tools
   - Track resource usage by category
   - Highlight when dev tools are resource-heavy

3. **Process Grouping**
   - Group Chrome tabs/processes
   - Group Electron apps
   - Show aggregated usage

4. **Historical Tracking**
   - 5-minute rolling window
   - Detect trends (increasing/decreasing)
   - Alert on anomalies

### Phase 4: Visual Polish (Week 4)
**Goal**: Implement Jony Ive-inspired visualizations

#### Tasks:
1. **System Health Ring**
   - Concentric rings for each metric
   - Smooth animations
   - Interactive (click to expand)

2. **Process Visualizations**
   - Horizontal bar charts
   - Color coding by category
   - Smooth transitions

3. **Enhanced Widgets**
   - Mini health ring for standard widget
   - Process highlights for detailed widget
   - Adaptive information density

4. **Animations & Transitions**
   - Spring animations for tabs
   - Smooth metric updates
   - Subtle hover effects

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**: Profile constantly, optimize hot paths, use sampling

### Risk: UI Complexity
**Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on usage, keep battery-only mode

### Risk: Process Monitoring Permissions  
**Mitigation**: Gracefully degrade, show what we can access

### Risk: Scope Creep
**Mitigation**: Stick to MVP, defer nice-to-haves to v2

## Future Expansion Ideas (v2)

- **Network Monitoring**: Bandwidth, connections
- **Disk Monitoring**: I/O, space usage
- **GPU Monitoring**: Usage, memory
- **Thermal Monitoring**: Temperature, throttling
- **App-Specific Insights**: Xcode build times, Docker container resources
- **Automation**: Scriptable actions based on system state
- **Historical Data**: Long-term trends, daily/weekly reports

## Getting Started

1. Create a new branch: `feature/system-monitoring`
2. Set up SystemCore framework structure  
3. Start with CPU monitoring (simplest)
4. Test thoroughly at each step
5. Get feedback early and often

This roadmap provides a clear path to transforming Microverse into a comprehensive system intelligence hub while maintaining the elegance and simplicity that makes it special.
